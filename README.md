# Data Mining Final Project Group 7
## INTRODUCTION
Our project focuses on identifying relationships and patterns between air quality indicators and health outcomes to determine which pollutants have the greatest negative impact on human health. By examining air pollution levels and overall air quality across different regions and time periods, we aim to uncover trends that highlight key environmental risk factors. Through this analysis, we hope to provide data-driven insights that can inform public health initiatives and guide future environmental policy decisions.

## ABOUT THE DATA


## METHODS
- Clustering will be the main model of use as it will allow us to see patterns between pollutant concentrations and negative health outcomes. Two clustering models will be created with standardized and non–standardized data. Both models will be compared to see if standardization improves the model’s grouping of data points.
- Linear Regression will be the secondary model that will be used in predicting the number of respiratory and cardiovascular cases and hospital admissions. The goal will be figuring out if one certain type of pollutant is better at predicting the number of negative health impacts.  Multivariable regression is potentially being considered along with creating single-variable models for each type of pollutant.
